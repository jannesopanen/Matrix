im going to introduce first the ref algorithm, also known as the gaussian row reduction algorithm.
and then in part 2, to get the matrix to the rref form, the gauss-jordan method is used. im going to
refer each cell of the matrix A, for example e
                                              (m)(n)
, for example cell at row five and at column 2 is denoted as 'e(5)(2)'

i define a arbitrary matrix A with columns and rows as m x n.

2.  set column and row counter counters both to 1, and call them respectively as c, and r.

1.  set float k = 1/e(r)(c),

2.  we know e(1)(r) equals one, so we do not have to compute that, simply we let e(1)(r) be 1.

3.  next we multiply the rest of the row r by k.




for (c = 0; c < colCount; c++) {
    float k = 1 / matrix[c][r];
    matrix[c][r] = 1;

    for (r = 0; r < rowCount; r++) {

    }
}
