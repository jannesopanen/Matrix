# My Matrix

While studying linear algebra, I noticed that I would love a proper tool for handing different kind of matrices.
There are CAS calculators, websites etc., but atleast my CAS and its matrix related tools were kind of slow and concise.

The point here is to build fully operational matrix tool, which can row reduce matrices, visualize the dependecies/indepencies of both coefficient matrices and augmented matricies. There was an issue with my CAS system and its row reducing capabilities, or lacking them, there were none interphases. I am going to introduce every step of the row reducing algorithm (both Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan).

If you have suggestions, feedback or want to buy me a coffee, please contact me at my email janne.sopanen@binaryiris.fi
